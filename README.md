# Web-Design-Challenge

This project involves creating a visualization dashboard website.
In building the dashboard, we created individual pages for each plot and navigation between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations.
We also have a landing page, a page for comparisons of all the plots, and another page to view the data used to build them.

This website consists of 7 pages total.
