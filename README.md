# Web-Design-Challenge

This project involves creating a visualization dashboard website for weather data for various cities of different latitudes. This data provides a relationship to the equator by temperature, wind speed, cloudiness and humidity.
In building the dashboard, we created individual pages for each plot and navigation between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations.
We also have a landing page, a page for comparisons of all the plots, and another page to view the data used to build them.

This website consists of 7 pages total using Bootstrap, CSS and HTML and is hosted on Github.
